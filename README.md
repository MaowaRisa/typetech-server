# Type tech - Mechanical Keyboard E-Commerce
This is a straightforward Express application designed to manage product and order functionalities. It offers an API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting, searching products and orders, utilizing Express and MongoDB using Mongoose. Additionally, ESLint and Prettier have been employed for code quality and formatting.

## Project API for products and orders management

In this project, I have meticulously followed several best practices and guidelines to ensure high-quality code:

### Coding Quality
#### Clean and Modular Code: 
The code is organized into modular components, each responsible for a specific functionality.
#### Consistent Naming Conventions: 
Variables, functions, and routes are named consistently and meaningfully to reflect their purpose.
#### Readability: 
Efforts have been made to ensure the code is easily readable and maintainable.

#### Inline Comments: 
Complex sections of code or logic are accompanied by inline comments to enhance understanding.

### API Endpoint Adherence
#### Strict Adherence to Structure: 
The API endpoints strictly follow the provided structure and naming conventions.
#### Request and Response Formats: 
All request and response formats match the specifications outlined in the assignment.

### Validation and Error Handling
#### Validation: 
Implemented validation using Zod for both product and order data.
#### Graceful Error Handling: 
Validation errors are handled gracefully, providing meaningful error messages in API responses.
#### Specific Error Scenarios: 
Error handling is implemented for scenarios such as product not found and validation errors.

### Coding Tools and Libraries
#### Manual Code Writing: 
No AI tools or libraries were used for generating code. All code is written manually to demonstrate a clear understanding of the concepts.

#### Specified Libraries: 
Only specified libraries like Express, Mongoose, and Zod are used, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
